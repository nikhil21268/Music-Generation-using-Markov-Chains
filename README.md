# Music Generation using Markov Chains
## Stochastic Processes and Applications Project
Created Python code to generate music, using Markov Chain based analysis. Used **Hello (Song by Adele)** for creation of Markov Chain states, and the subsequent music generation.


## Project Overview

This repository contains code for the "Music Generation using Markov Chains" project. The primary code is provided in the `SPA_Project_Final.ipynb` file located in the Code folder. The project involves using Markov Chains for the generation of musical sequences, with datasets available in the `Chord_Progression_DataSet` folder.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the code on Kaggle.com or your local machine.

### Running on Kaggle.com

1. Import the `SPA_Project_Final.ipynb` file from the Code folder to Kaggle.com.
2. Upload the datasets provided in the `Chord_Progression_DataSet` folder to the Kaggle notebook.
3. Adjust the path in the Kaggle notebook if required.
4. Run the notebook.

### Running on Local Machine

1. Open the `SPA_Project_Final.ipynb` file from the Code folder using VS Code or any Jupyter Notebook compatible environment.
2. Adjust the path for the input files located in the `Chord_Progression_DataSet` folder.
3. Run the notebook.

## File Structure

- **Code:** Contains the main Jupyter Notebook file (`SPA_Project_Final.ipynb`).
- **Chord_Progression_DataSet:** Contains datasets required for the analysis.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your environment. The notebook may require specific libraries; refer to the code for details.

## Note

- The code is structured for both Kaggle and local machine execution.
- Make sure to adjust the path for datasets as instructed.
- For any additional queries or issues, contact the project maintainers.

Happy generating musical sequences with Markov Chains!
